Dear Keliya,

Transient start should be near the rise of the transient.
Data start marks the data to be used for the fit and should be at the 
top of the transient or just after.
Transient end should be as large as possible, but exclude any strange 
data at the end to the time period.
The total time period should be at least 8 times the expected lifetime, 
if possible.
Threshold should be set to save time by not processing background pixels 
and its value will vary depending on your experiment. Set it at maybe 20 
photon counts.

You should fix these cursors and threshold for a given data set. Usually 
you are looking for a change in lifetime so the absolute lifetime value 
is not critical.

Hope that helps,
Paul.
