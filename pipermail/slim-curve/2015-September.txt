Hi Robert,

Thanks for the report. I was able to reproduce with a fully updated Fiji +
SLIM-Curve update site.

I fixed the problem [1], and uploaded the new version to the update site.

Not sure what you mean by that, but I'm surprised that would make a
difference. There was a legitimate deadlock issue in the code. The main
mystery is why it ever worked at all prior to the latest version of ImageJ.

Anyway, give it a try and let us know if this fix resolves the problem for
you!

Regards,
Curtis
