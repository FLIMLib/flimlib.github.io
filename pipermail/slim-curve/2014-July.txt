Subject: [SLIM-Curve] SLIM Curve project next steps
Message-ID: <CADN69y=dhaiLF5MfPL8h1VtFAgWLisP-2wOh_mG6-cJa=KspYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Starting today, one of our developers here at LOCI, Md Abdul Kader Sagar,
will be working on improving the SLIM Curve codebase, including both the C
library as needed, as well as the ImageJ plugin.

Today we discussed initial steps for getting acquainted with SLIM Curve.
They are:

Read the SLIM Curve website (http://slim-curve.github.io/) to get familiar
with SLIM Curve, and the various ways of using it.

Read the SLIM Curve plugin wiki page (http://fiji.sc/SLIM_Curve) to learn
about the functionality of the SLIM Curve plugin for ImageJ.

To see the plan for the various SLIM Curve repositories, see the SLIM Curve
wiki, as well as open issues for the C library and Java plugin code:
* https://github.com/slim-curve/slim-curve/wiki
* https://github.com/slim-curve/slim-curve/issues
* https://github.com/slim-curve/slim-plugin/issues

Sagar will try using SLIM Curve in its various incarnations, as follows:

1) Read the SLIM Curve paper draft.
2) Install Fiji, enable SLIM Curve update site; try to use the SLIM Curve
plugin to analyze some SDT lifetime data.
3) Try using SLIM Curve from the command line, as well as MATLAB.
4) Download TRI2, try using that to analyze the same data.

Sagar and I will meet again next week to discuss issues that have arisen
from this exploration. And we'll follow up on this mailing list with
prioritization of next steps afterward.

Regards,
Curtis
