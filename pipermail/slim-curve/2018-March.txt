Hi everyone,

Hopefully this mail list is still active and is just not very busy.

I came across the SLIM-Curve plugin for IMageJ/FII while looking up details of the Tri2 package as I have some FLIM data that I am having difficulty fitting.

When I saw that a macro-compatible FLIM fitting plugin as available I thought that this could be the best thing since sliced bread, but the only problem is that my data is in OME-TIFF format (each time bin is stored as an image in a z-stack) and it does not seem to be compatible with SLIM-Curve.

I was wondering if there is perhaps any chance that OME-TIFFs might be made a valid format? For example, the laser repetition frequency could be manually inputed and the  data order could be defined somehow.

I don’t know how easy this would be to implement but it would be a real saviour.

Cheers,

Ewan

HI Ewan,

I would recommend for now not using SLIM-Curve and instead using TRI-2. We have lots of work on SLIM-Curve and its very incomplete in scripting and other areas. We don't currently have someone working on supporting this so for real data best to use TRI2.
