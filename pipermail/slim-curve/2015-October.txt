Subject: [SLIM-Curve] SLIM Curve plugin - version on update site broken,
 on github it's fine

Hi Curtis,

it appears working here as well. So thanks for the fix. Regarding the 
Github issue: I guess potential deadlocks appear sometimes and sometimes 
not. So, I thought it has something to do with a difference between 
update site and github, but obviously it has not.

So fine, fixed. :)

Have a nice weekend!

Best,
Robert

Subject: [SLIM-Curve] parameter differences between FIJI an SPCImage5
Message-ID: <487442075.7487753.1445946053260.JavaMail.zimbra@mpi-cbg.de>

Hello,

The Photon Counting device I use, uses SPCImage5.0 to collect data (.sdt). 
I noticed that when opening files, FIJI Slim Curve usually sets the transient end time as 230 (display as indices), in comparison to SPCImage5.0 T2 value, usually sets to 240.

I want to know what settings I should have, as well as what the Data Start value means.

When I leave Transient End value and Data Start value alone, only changing Transient Start value, my lifetime value does not change.
But when I do the other way round, the T(lifetime) value changes a lot.
This makes me wonder what to set for these parameters (Transient Start, Data Start, Transient End, Threshold) for my Photon Counting documents.

I'd be very much appreciated if you could help me with a better understanding of the logarithm behind the program, which I didn't get enough from the website, http://fiji.sc/SLIM_Curve.

Thank you very much.
Looking forward to your reply.

Best wishes,
Keliya Bai
