Hi Steve,

I am CCing the slim-curve mailing list, which is the best place to ask
questions about SLIM Curve.

This quartiles are computed from the histogram like so:

https://github.com/slim-curve/slim-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/loci/slim/histogram/HistogramDataNode.java#L165-L254

And then applied to a HistogramStatistics object:

https://github.com/slim-curve/slim-plugin/blob/5b12b4f64bd07318a47615b96215892336d706eb/src/main/java/loci/slim/histogram/HistogramDataGroup.java#L451-L460

You could override the quartile values using Java code, but then they
wouldn't really be "quartile" values anymore from a mathematical
perspective, since the actual distribution would not match what you define
as quartile boundaries.

Can you be more specific about what you are trying to achieve?

Regards,
Curtis
