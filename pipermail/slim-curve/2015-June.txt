I'm CCing the slim-curve mailing list, which is the best place to discuss
these issues.

Unfortunately, I have not had any significant time to work on the SDT
issues. However, I did pass along your issue to Sagar (CCed), the current
maintainer of the SLIM Curve plugin for ImageJ.

Your image appears to be a FIFO image, which is currently not supported in
ImageJ or SCIFIO. But Sagar is actively working on adding support for FIFO
images to our software, since we have some of those here in our lab as well.

Sagar, please let me know if you need any guidance or support on this
project. Or if you have any workarounds that Doogie can use in the meantime.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis,

For now the best workaround would be using SPCM to decompress the image. In
FIFO mode, the images are compressed to save space, even though they are
both *.SDT format.

For converting(using SPCM), go to File-> Convert-> SDT Files

In destination file format, select SDT unzipped(I have attached a
screenshot for clarification). Let me know if this was helpful.

Thanks

Best regards,
